- What’s in it for me? Fight on the frontlines alongside a group of women who stood up to ISIS.
- The northern Syrian city of Kobani was surrounded. Battle-hardened fighters from the Islamic extremist group ISIS controlled three-quarters of the city; their tanks had advanced to Mishtanour, a strategic hilltop nearby.
- For days, militias fought ISIS on Mishtanour until they were commanded to withdraw. But some fighters didn’t obey the order. Among them was a woman named Arin Mirkan. Instead of pulling back, Mirkan decided to strap a grenade to her waist and charge an oncoming ISIS tank. When she reached the tank, she detonated the grenade, killing herself and all of the fighters inside.
- Mirkan was part of a militia led entirely by women –⁠ the “daughters” of Kobani whose goals went beyond simply defeating ISIS. They were also fighting for women’s rights in a culture that claimed women had none. These blinks tell the stories of four incredible women –⁠ Azeema, Rojda, Nowruz, and Znarin –⁠ who took part in that fight.
- A warning before we begin: These blinks contain disturbing accounts of violence, sexual abuse, and misogyny.
- In these blinks, you’ll learn
	- how a soccer match eventually led to a civil war;
	- what happened when Azeema got shot; and
	- how the women-led Kurdish forces helped take back Raqqa.
